### JPMorgan Chase & Co. Empowering Minorities Award 
At Hack The Burgh 2019 my team and I created [HearMe](https://devpost.com/software/hear-me), a web app designed to help make phone calls easier for people with hearing difficulties, as well as people struggling with anxiety. To create this we used the Nexmo API to translate conversation on both ends to make the call accessible for both parties.
