# Group Projects

## UPLIFT.ED Project
<em>Role: Front-end developer</em>

Team UPLIFT designed the product UPLIFT.ED, referred to as "ED" (Elevation Device). ED is an assistive robot designed primarily to aid mobility impaired consumers reach low down drawers by elevating an inner basket of a cabinet drawer to counter-top height. Working as part of the app design team, my main contributions consisted of designing the initial user interface for the app, implementing the front-end and back-end coding of the app, and designing graphic assets for the team. Throughout the process my team and I learned how to effectively work as a team, learned how to use ROS and Webots, and how to connect the app to Webots using The Standard ROS JavaScript Library.

My contribution and the lessons I learned can be found [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/moaylesbury/ED-Report/blob/main/s1751472-MichaelAylesbury-Group-15.pdf).

## Search Engine Project
<em>Role: Back-end developer</em>

This report details the functionality of our custom Song Lyric Search Engine developed for the Text Technologies for Data Science group project. Our website serves as an intuitive GUI allowing the user to perform boolean, phrase, proximity, and ranked lyrics queries in English and Spanish, all whilst filtering by artist, album, and mood is allowed. We have logically split this report into the two components making up our solution: frontend and backend, within which we explore some of the key technologies and approaches we use in our solution. The report then describes the testing suites performed on the developed website and finally concludes with the individual contributions of each group member.

My contributions and a specification of the system can be found [here]().



## Machine Learning Project
<em>Role: Researcher and writer</em>

In this work, we explore semantic image segmentation in a supervised regime to evaluate and improve the robustness of the state-of-theart DeepLabv3+ architecture across the PASCAL Visual Object Challenge (VOC) 2012 data set. Through experimentation it is found that the baseline model (DeepLabv3+) performance degrades for the image augmentations such as gaussian blur, cutout, and scaling. We propose three models to combat these perturbation within images. The proposed variants are deformable convolution, hierarchical attention, and hierarchical attention paired with a contour detection model. Our proposed networks were able to outperform the baseline MIoU score by 2%, and were more robust to the aforementioned perturbations, evaluated using the Corruption Degradation (CD) metric. We found that our proposed deformable convolution model was more robust to scaling (CD = 0.9) compared to the baseline, and additionally, both variations of the hierarchical attention model were robust against perturbations such as cutout and Gaussian blur (CD = 0.95).
