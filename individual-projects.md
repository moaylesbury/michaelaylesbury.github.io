# Individual Projects

### Sudoku Solver

A sudoku game created in python using the modules tkinter and numpy.

This was my first time using tkinter, so it was interesting exploring the module to create a GUI. Numpy was used to create a matrix representation of the sudoku board.

Aside from the grid, the interface consists of four buttons: Solve, New Board, Reset Board, and Solve.

The solve button makes use of the [recursive backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Backtracking), trying numbers 1-9. If the board cannot be solved then the algorithm goes back and tries different numbers until the board is solved.

In the future I would create a more sophisticated board generating algorithm, as the current one ends up with trends such as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in the first line and consecutive numbers appearing often.

### Sorting Algorithm Visualiser (Unfinished)

I was interested in the computational theory behind sorting algorithms, as well as how these algorithms could be effectively visualised. I researched insertion sort, merge sort, selection sort, quick sort and pancake sort. From this research I compiled a document of [my findings](https://nbviewer.org/github/moaylesbury/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser/blob/master/Research/Sorting%20Algorithm%20Research.pdf), including how the algorithms work and their time complexities.

To get an idea of how these algorithms actually work in practice, I implemented their functionalities in Python and tried different test cases. From here I moved onto creating a web applciation using React. This was my first experience creating visual elements in JavaScript that move as internal data changes
