# Undergraduate Thesis
> Python, Jupyter Notebook, MLIR, LLVM

Intermediate representation is a format utilised by compilers as a step between source code and machine code, which is traditionally difficult for humans to understand. The development of compiler infrastructure introduces the LLVM IR, followed by MultiLevel Intermediate Representation (MLIR) and xDSL, revolutionising IR syntax and structure. As a result, these IRs are human-readable, and human-writeable. This project introduces the Multi-Level Visual Intermediate Representation (MLVIR) and the MLVIR tool, that converts xDSL IR into MLVIR, visualising and further improving the readability of IR. It additionally allows for linear pattern matching and rewriting of MLVIR.
