## Undergraduate Thesis

In 2022 I completed my undergraduate thesis entitled "An Interactive Web Explorer For Compilers". It encapsulates the formulation and design of the Multi-Level Visual Intermediate Representation (MLVIR) for Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR), an intermediate representation developed under the LLVM compiler framework umbrella. MLVIR provides a visual, compressed, nested IR structure allowing for effective visualisation of IRs, both small and very large. This project also presents the MLVIR tool, written in a Jupyter Notebook in Python, making use of the xDSL toolkit. The MLVIR tool allows IR input for MLVIR generation, as well as exploration of pattern matching and rewriting over such an MLVIR. The thesis can be seen below.
